For nearly 10 years or so, hospitals have been struggling with how to effectively and profitably reinvent themselves. The direction is to become increasingly consumer-direct.
Among the transformational market forces are the informed and empowered public, increasing competitive pressures, and the desire for hospitals to serve women and other demographic groups. Sprinkle into this recipe the overarching goals of delivering first-class health care, top-rated patient service and satisfaction, and broad brand recognition.
Inpatient facilities that aggressively took up the challenge a few years ago are now leading the power curve, often emerging as “patient preferred” amid today’s retail-oriented and consumer-centric medical marketplace.
“Perhaps as a result, the proportion of patients who say they would definitely recommend UCLA to family and friends has increased by 20 percent (from 71 percent to 85 percent), according to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS).
In our view, highly qualified and experienced physicians, surgeons, medical staff and state-of-the-art facilities are primary factors in hospital excellence. For a typical consumer, however, quality is often perceived by less-clinical values such as interpersonal communications, a culture of customer service, and hospitality-based amenities. Patients, family and friends easily recognize the “creature comfort” things that patients care about.
Throughout the nation, marketing, advertising and public relations messages of hospitals and health systems have taken a page from upscale players in the hospitality industry. They show the dazzle factor and emphasize the progressive and healthy-living qualities that appeal to the public/consumer.

For nearly 10 years or so, hospitals have been struggling with how to effectively and profitably reinvent themselves. The direction is to become increasingly consumer-direct.
Among the transformational market forces are the informed and empowered public, increasing competitive pressures, and the desire for hospitals to serve women and other demographic groups. Sprinkle into this recipe the overarching goals of delivering first-class health care, top-rated patient service and satisfaction, and broad brand recognition.
Inpatient facilities that aggressively took up the challenge a few years ago are now leading the power curve, often emerging as “patient preferred” amid today’s retail-oriented and consumer-centric medical marketplace.
“Perhaps as a result, the proportion of patients who say they would definitely recommend UCLA to family and friends has increased by 20 percent (from 71 percent to 85 percent), according to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS).
In our view, highly qualified and experienced physicians, surgeons, medical staff and state-of-the-art facilities are primary factors in hospital excellence. For a typical consumer, however, quality is often perceived by less-clinical values such as interpersonal communications, a culture of customer service, and hospitality-based amenities.

For nearly 10 years or so, hospitals have been struggling with how to effectively and profitably reinvent themselves. The direction is to become increasingly consumer-direct.
Among the transformational market forces are the informed and empowered public, increasing competitive pressures, and the desire for hospitals to serve women and other demographic groups. Sprinkle into this recipe the overarching goals of delivering first-class health care, top-rated patient service and satisfaction, and broad brand recognition.
Inpatient facilities that aggressively took up the challenge a few years ago are now leading the power curve, often emerging as “patient preferred” amid today’s retail-oriented and consumer-centric medical marketplace.
“Perhaps as a result, the proportion of patients who say they would definitely recommend UCLA to family and friends has increased by 20 percent (from 71 percent to 85 percent), according to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS).
In our view, highly qualified and experienced physicians, surgeons, medical staff and state-of-the-art facilities are primary factors in hospital excellence. For a typical consumer, however, quality is often perceived by less-clinical values such as interpersonal communications, a culture of customer service, and hospitality-based amenities. Patients, family and friends easily recognize the “creature comfort” things that patients care about.
Throughout the nation, marketing, advertising and public relations messages of hospitals and health systems have taken a page from upscale players in the hospitality industry. They show the dazzle factor and emphasize the progressive and healthy-living qualities that appeal to the public/consumer.
