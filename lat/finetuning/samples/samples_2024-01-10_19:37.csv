For nearly 10 years or so, hospitals have been struggling with how to effectively and profitably reinvent themselves. The direction is to become increasingly consumer-direct.
Among the transformational market forces are the informed and empowered public, increasing competitive pressures, and the desire for hospitals to serve women and other demographic groups. Sprinkle into this recipe the overarching goals of delivering first-class health care, top-rated patient service and satisfaction, and broad brand recognition.

Even with more than 40 examples–some familiar, some novel–the following list is incomplete. Tell us what your hospital is doing, and what would you add to this list?
For related reading, see our previous post: Why Hospital Marketing Has an Incentive to Compete with Amenities, as well as reference articles including, Health Care Hospitality (Arkansas Business), and Pampering Patients (Seattle Business).
We’d like to hear from you. What amenities have been successful for your hospital or facility? What’s working, and what’s not? Your comments are welcome.
